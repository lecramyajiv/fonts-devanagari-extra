# Yatra One
Yatra is a Devanagari and Latin libre font inspired by the hand-painted signage of the Mumbai local railway.

This heavy weight high-contrast display face preserves the idiosyncratic character of brush-painted signage by featuring angular cuts and open knots. Notably, the Latin adopts a Devanagari brush angle.

A Mumbai native, Yatra offers basic Marathi alternates.

It is built on top of the [ITF Base Devanagari (for Google Fonts)](https://github.com/itfoundry/base-devanagari-gf). 

Please see tests and proofs in /proofs. A web-based specimen is coming shortly.
