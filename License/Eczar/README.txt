# Eczar

**Eczar** is an open-source type family published by [Rosetta](https://rosettatype.com) with generous financial support from Google. The fonts support over 45+3 languages in Latin and Devanagari scripts in 5 weights. It was designed by Vaibhav Singh ([@errorsinc](http://github.com/errorsinc)), code and production is by [David Březina](http://davi.cz) ([@MrBrezina](http://github.com/MrBrezina)).


Eczar started as a student project in 2010–11 during Vaibhav’s MA studies in Typeface Design at the University of Reading. Eczar was designed to bring liveliness and vigor to multi-script typesetting in Latin and Devanagari – with the intention of providing an alternative to existing designs by imparting a strong mix of personality and performance, both at text sizes and in display settings. The family offers a wide expressive range and the display qualities of the design intensify with corresponding increase in weight, making the heaviest weights best suited for headlines and display purposes.

## Rosetta – world typography specialists

Rosetta addresses the needs of global typography. Together with our collaborators we create original fonts for a polyphonic world. Our work has been featured and awarded. But most importantly it has enabled people to read better in their native language.

So far our retail library supports pan-European Latin, Arabic, Armenian, Greek, Cyrillic (besides Slavic languages we also support many Asian languages), Inuktitut, and Indic scripts like Gujarati and Devanagari. In total, the library covers more than 200 languages.
