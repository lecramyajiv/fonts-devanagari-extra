### Basic Font Information
Sarala is a devanagari font based on Telex Regular free font, with 2 weights (Bold and Regular)

Telex Regular is a humanist sans serif conceived to be a web font with nice legibility at normal text sizes. Originally based on grid fitting shapes it became a multi-purpose typeface with low contrast, open counter forms, wide proportions and a touch of freshness.
