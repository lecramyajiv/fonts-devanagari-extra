Sura | Devanagari font

This file provides detailed information on the Sura font software. This information should be distributed along with the Sura fonts and any derivative works.

Sura is a devanagari font based on Andada Regular free font, with 2 weights (Bold and Regular)

Andada ht is a typeface for text, is an organic-slab serif, hybrid style and a solid design of medium stroke contrast. 
It is a type for text written in Guaraní and Spanish. The main goal of its design is not reducing a culture to an aesthetic fact. The «pusó», an inter vowel sign that the Guaraní language uses similar to an apostrophe, was designed in consonance with the vowels and, from this sign, the diacritics (which Guaraní heavily uses) were designed. The digraphs were created by pairs, instead of designing them as ligatures. Particular attention was paid to the diacritics design so they could have a great performance in languages where its use is frequent.
