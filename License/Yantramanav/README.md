Yantramanav यंत्रमानव 
=====

Yantramanav is a Devanagari typeface family designed by [Erin McLaughlin](http://www.erinmclaughlin.com). 

The style and weights of Yantramanav Devanagari were designed as a complement to the Latin glyphs of [Roboto](http://www.google.com/fonts/specimen/Roboto), a family designed by Christian Robertson.

Yantramanav will be available for free via the Google Web Fonts project.
